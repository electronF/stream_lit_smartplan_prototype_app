# stream_lit_smartplan_prototype_app

This repository contains the streamlined frontend code of the SmartPlanAI application 
prototype.

To run it type
```shell
cd full_interface
streamlit run Utilisateur_Utilisateur.py
```

On the page You can fill the form for the *'Utilisateur Utilisateur'* tab and press 
*'Recommander'* Some message will be displayed.

**Note**: that this app is a fast app so the architecture is not good and the code is 
simple. The 
main key where to build something usable to test some algorithms.

Enjoy ! ;)
